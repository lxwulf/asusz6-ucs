This is a information guide for updating the Asus Zenfone 6 manually when your phone is rooted via official from asus. There is also a script which help to remove the unwanted google apps.

My idea is to make it a little bit easier to update your asus zenfone 6. So however this script works also only on this special phone and not on another phone. another thing is also of course you need to be rooted and give the script root permission because the google apps are on the system folders.
